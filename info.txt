Project Organization
The code is now organized into a clear directory structure:

app.py - Main entry point that runs the Flask web server
src/ directory - Contains the core application logic
static/ directory - Contains CSS and JavaScript for the web interface
templates/ directory - Contains the HTML template

Key Components

Core Components:

morse_converter.py: Handles Morse code conversion logic
blink_detector.py: Handles eye detection and blink processing
tts_engine.py: Manages text-to-speech functionality


User Interface:

Split view UI with camera feed on the left and information on the right
Responsive design with CSS for better user experience
JavaScript that updates decoded text and camera status automatically


Improvements:

Better separation of concerns (UI vs. core logic)
More maintainable code structure
Added a reset button to clear decoded text
Added camera status indicator
Improved error handling



How to Run

Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application:
python app.py

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8081

The application functionality remains the same as the original, but with a cleaner architecture that makes it easier to maintain and extend in the future.
